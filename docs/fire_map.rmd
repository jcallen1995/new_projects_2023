So, to start out I need to get some data. I'm thinking of taking; 
 - California Counties data
  * US boundaries data package thing should have it.
 - average rainfall
 - county population
 - fire polygons or rasters
 - city names
  * I think the uscities.csv file should work, but I need to learn the
    source for it.
 - city polygons
 
and basically combining all of these into an interractive map that
the user can zoom in using the leaflet package, flip through the 
years and also see a graph showing the estimated number of people
whose lives were affected by the fires. I could also add other fitting
data if I find good sources, but realistically, I might struggle to
even find the data that I have listed here.

Tomorrow I'll get started tracking down the data.
